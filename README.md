# A little practice project solely for myself. 
The Idea is to have an array of quotes, without any specific theme or similar, instead merely quotes that I like be it poetry, prose, litle parables or whatever. 
When the user clicks the button one of these quotes will show on the page. A few possible solutions for this, either randomized, or just looping through in order and then going back to the begining when the user reaches the end. 
Could make it so that it shows a new quote everyday or something along those lines as well. 

Pretty simple project overall, just to practice a few things with javascript:
*DOM manipulation
*arrays
*loops

And while I build it try to remeber to document and reflect over what I've learned and found easy/hard or whatever.
