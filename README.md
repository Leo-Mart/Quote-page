# A little practice project mainly for myself. 
The Idea is to have an array of quotes, without any specific theme or similar, instead merely quotes that I like be it poetry, prose, litle parables or whatever. 
When the user clicks the button one of these quotes will show on the page. A few possible solutions for this, either randomized, or just looping through in order and then going back to the begining when the user reaches the end. 
Could make it so that it shows a new quote everyday or something along those lines as well. ANd add a countdown to the next day for instance

A further development could be to import quotes from a text file so I dont have to manually add stuff into the array everytime but instead do it dynamically somehow. 
Could also import from a API somewhere with fetch.

Maybe let the user display all the quotes.
Or a tag system to display all the quotes by a certain author or with a specific theme or similar
Add it all to a database and possibly let users add in their own quotes that will then show up on the page.

Pretty simple project overall, just to practice a few things with javascript:
*DOM manipulation
*arrays
*loops

And while I build it try to remember to document and reflect over what I've learned and found easy/hard or whatever.
